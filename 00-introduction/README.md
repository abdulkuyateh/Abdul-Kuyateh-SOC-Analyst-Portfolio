# Introduction

Hi! I’m **Abdul Kuyateh**, and this is my SOC Analyst Portfolio.  

This repository is a collection of hands-on projects, labs, and exercises I’ve completed while training with the **MYDFIR community**. It’s designed to showcase the skills I’ve built and document my journey as I prepare for a SOC Analyst role.  

## Purpose of This Repo

- Apply what I’m learning in real-world SOC scenarios.  
- Document and demonstrate practical SOC skills.  
- Build a professional portfolio to show employers my capabilities.  

## How This Repo is Organized

Each main project folder contains:

- `README.md` → Overview of the project and workflow.  
- `part-x/` → Step-by-step lab/project files.  
- `skills-gained.md` → Key skills I learned and applied.  
- Optional troubleshooting guides when needed.  

Folders are organized to show a **logical progression** from basic SOC labs to advanced automation and community projects.  

## Why This Matters

- Keeps my projects organized and easy to follow.  
- Shows my learning progression and practical SOC skills.  
- Makes my portfolio recruiter-friendly and professional.  
- Helps me track my growth and document real-world SOC workflows.
