# Abdul-Kuyateh SOC Analyst Portfolio 🛡️

Welcome! I’m **Abdul Kuyateh**, and this is my SOC Analyst Portfolio.  
This repository showcases my hands-on projects, lab exercises, and community-based learning with **MYDFIR**. It is designed to demonstrate practical SOC skills, document my journey, and give you a clear view of what I can do.

## Why This Portfolio Stands Out ✨

This portfolio is all about **doing the work** — not just listing tools or theory. Here, you’ll see projects I’ve built to:

- Apply SOC concepts in real-world scenarios  
- Solve problems or automate tasks like a working analyst  
- Build dashboards, detection pipelines, and threat intel workflows  
- Investigate endpoints, analyze logs, and document findings clearly  
- Share work that is ready for feedback and continuous improvement  

Whether it’s standing up a honeypot, running an AD attack simulation, or automating a small SOC workflow, every project reflects **practical skills and real-world thinking**.

## How to Navigate 🧭

1. Start with this README for context.  
2. Read `00-introduction/README.md` for detailed portfolio guidance.  
3. Follow numbered folders sequentially (`01-homelab/` → `09-mdsa-projects/`) to see my skill progression.  

Each folder includes:  

- `README.md` → Project overview and step-by-step documentation  
- `skills-gained.md` → Resume-ready skills and applied techniques

## What to Expect in Each Project 📝

I follow a **simple, consistent format** so anyone can understand my work:

- **Project Name** – What I built  
- **Objective** – What I aimed to learn, test, or improve  
- **Tools Used** – Splunk, Sentinel, KQL, MISP, OpenVAS, etc.  
- **Process** – Steps, screenshots, diagrams, configs  
- **Challenges + Fixes** – Problems I faced and solutions  
- **Takeaways** – New skills and lessons learned  
- **Next Steps** – Optional improvements or experiments
